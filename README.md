# EEG Signal Preprocessing and Seizure Detection Using EEGLAB, SVM, and KNN

This repository contains the implementation of EEG signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning-based seizure detection. The project is divided into two phases, documented in `Report-Phase1.pdf` and `Report-Phase2.pdf`.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to preprocess EEG signals, extract meaningful features, and train machine learning models (**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**) for epileptic seizure detection. The workflow is as follows:

1. **Phase 1: Preprocessing**  
   - Raw EEG signals are preprocessed using **EEGLAB**.  
   - Steps include filtering, artifact removal, and signal cleaning.  
   - Detailed implementation and results are documented in `Report-Phase1.pdf`.

2. **Phase 2: Feature Extraction and Classification**  
   - Features are extracted from the preprocessed EEG signals.  
   - The extracted features are used to train and evaluate **SVM** and **KNN** models for seizure detection.  
   - Detailed implementation, results, and analysis are documented in `Report-Phase2.pdf`.
